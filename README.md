# Discord-Custom-RPC
I made a python script that allows you to connect to Discord locally and update your rich presence in real time! All you have to do is make a application in Discord Developer Portal, name it, give it a icon and copy the ID for the script!

EXE IS IN RELEASES, I SUCK AT USING GITHUB!

Prerequisites for the python script

pip install ttkbootstrap pypresence pyinstaller

Converted to EXE, python script will be in src

To get started go to https://discord.com/developers/applications - Click New Application - Give it a name and ✅By clicking Create, you agree to the Discord Developer Terms of Service - Add a icon - Copy Application ID - Run The EXE and Paste the Application ID where it says Client ID - Add your Details and State - Ignore Large and Small Image Text, currently broken! You can add and save as many presets as you want, along with changing the theme! Any changes made will create a rpc_presets.json. Themes and Presets save for easy access!
